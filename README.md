# Stock Price Simulation

The program will generate random scenarios using the stv the stock using python.
If you want to give it a try, you can change the date from where you would like to start and also the security you want to use, in my case I tryed MSFT.


The intention behind the program was to test some of the functions inside numpy. This is not something that give any actual insigth about a security's future performance.
